Starbreeze Work Test -- Gameplay Programmer
============================================

Background
----------

Starbreeze uses fully featured, modern, object-oriented scripting languages.
Scripting in Starbreeze games goes far beyond simply connecting triggers and
events. In fact, the entire gameplay logic: animation, AI, vehicles, etc,
is written in the scripting language. This gives great flexibility, but it
also puts a high demand on the scripter. She must not only be able to
think and learn quickly but also have good general programming and problem
solving skills.


The Task
--------

The task is to create Whakman, a simple Pacman like game using the 
scripting language Lua <http://www.lua.org/> and SDL
<http://www.libsdl.org/> with various extensions added (SDL_Image,
SDL_ttf, SDL_Net and SDL_Mixer)
We provide some images and scripts to get you started.

You can choose to do a straight up Pacman clone, a Pacman game with
some kind of twist or a completely different game. Choose whatever is
more interesting to you.

Submit the finished code to us, together with a short note (in Swedish
or English). In the note you should tell us what we should look for in
your submission, what you are the most proud of in the implementation and
what you wanted to have done better.


Instructions
------------

1.  Test Whakman by executing luasdl.exe. The game initialization code
	is in __init__.lua.

2.	You should see a window with some walls, Whakman, a ghost and a simple OSD.

3.	Write your own game. Use the code in `Whakman.lua` as an example on
	how to load and draw images, fonts etc.. Your code does not need to follow 
	the structure of `Whakman.lua`, feel free to reorganize and refactor if you 
	think it makes the code better.
